Our goal is to expand availability of opportunities arising from new, decentralized technologies.

DeSoLabs is an open, technology-centric community originating from DeSo ecosystem and inspired by changes happening globally in the free and open-source development 'world'.

We are organizing community recognition awards, hackathons, and help people in setting themselves up in the new, decentralized reality.

## Why is this cool?

DeSo Labs is decentralizing development of social networks.
We want to have an alternative. 
Be able to try out other tools, search engines, authentication models, storages... All these experiments are open source and contribute towards our progress to the decentralized future. We expect our code to be cherrypicked and merged upstream to core or other community code-bases.

We want the designers to be able to see for themselves how their proposed changes will work live, we want product creators to be able to publish features early, and gather professional and n00b feedback. All of this without the need to consider all the implications of making changes to the core codebase.

We are all creators, but building software is hard to make it socially attractive. 

## What's in it for you?

Community developers are struggling to get their work hyped up and often lack skills and tools to launch and make their creations visible on the internet. 
Through the "Community Recognition Awards" and "Community Hackathons" we help promoting the work done by independent makers, and provide community support to many builders.

## Who is on the team?

We're a young community in the making, but thankfully we have gathered a great suite of founders from all around the world that share the same vision, and want to contribute to the distrubuted future we all envision.
As a distributed, social construct, DeSoLabs doesn't have and probably will never have a hierarchy.

## How can you support?

We use the Deso contributions from the community in the following ways:
* the Founder's reward collected via Creator Coins is used for recognition awards given to builders on DeSo.
* the NFT contributions are used for hackathon awards

## How to get verified?

All of the accounts that have demonstrated profficiency in participating in the software world, are building or using software 
to ones benefit, (eg. cyborgs, developers, enthusiasts, testers, designers) and have shown a <i>sign of good will</i> get a verification badge.

Still, we want our node to be the place where we can all collaborate in a respectful and impactful manner, so we require community members to be respectful and mindful of others.
